# SMS-SPAM-DETECTION
A PROJECT OF MACHINE LEARNING ON SMS SPAM DETECTION USING PYTHON
This is a comprehensive project that tackles the persistent issue of spam SMS messages using a data-driven approach. Leveraging a diverse dataset from Kaggle, I conducted extensive data analysis to gain insights into the characteristics of spam and legitimate SMS messages. With a deep understanding of the data, I employed the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm for predictive analysis, building a robust model to classify incoming messages as spam or not-spam.

Data Analysis Expertise: This project began with a thorough exploration and analysis of a Kaggle dataset comprising SMS messages. By identifying patterns, trends, and features that distinguish spam from legitimate messages, I gained crucial insights for model training.

Predictive Analysis with Naive Bayes: Armed with the insights from data analysis, I implemented the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm for predictive analysis. This algorithm excels in text classification tasks, making it a suitable choice for identifying spam SMS messages accurately.

Model Training and Validation: I divided the dataset into training and validation sets, ensuring the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities. The Naive Bayes model learned from the dataset's patterns to distinguish between different categories of messages.

Streamlit Web Application: To make the benefits of this project accessible to users, I transformed the predictive model into an interactive web application using Streamlit. The web app provides a user-friendly interface where users can input SMS messages to get instant predictions on whether the message is spam or not.

Real-Time Classification: The web application operates in real time, allowing users to test and classify SMS messages on the spot. It provides quick results, enhancing the user experience and efficiency.
